Welcome to my dotFiles.

### Configs for
* Neovim
* Kitty terminal
* Hyprland environment
* Waybar
* ...more stuff

### Some considerations

If you're planning to use some of my configs (specially hyprland) you need to understand
that the most of the values (heights and widths) are completely custom for MY SETUP. I don't
have a "common" resolution of display, my keyboard is not US distribution, my color setup
is calibrated for my display and environment lights, and more stuff... So, consider it for
your own porpuses.

I recommend first trying to replicate it in your own `.conf` file, and if it works then you
can clone my repo and try it.
